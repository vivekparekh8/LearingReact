# LearingReact
Learn React.js from scratch.

## Basics of React

* Transpiling  - Babeljs
* Components always output only one html element
* Anything in curly braces {} inside jsx i.e. return (...) will be executed as js, self executing anonymous function, invoke class methods, have a constructor in class
* Data management - state : this.state (only on that component) - Updates on virtual DOM, modifies real DOM only on change in virtual i.e. only that particular element is modified
* Data management - props : Passed herarchically(top to down) (Similar to properties or attributes in HTML tags)
